This project forked version *2.8.0* of [Android-Image-Cropper](https://github.com/ArthurHub/Android-Image-Cropper)
The reason for the fork is that our project cannot depend on Android X yet and this library required us
to move to Android X before we are ready. But we still needed API 28 fixes.

## Change log

*0.1.0* GameChanger version 
 - Reverted Android-X and using API 28 support library 
 - Publish script updates
